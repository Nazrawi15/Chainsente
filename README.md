# Chainsente — Complete Repository (Aiken)

This repository is an expanded, production-style repository intended to back the Chainsente Catalyst proposal.
It includes Aiken contracts, a CLI simulator, tools for price oracle simulation, data-processing scripts, mobile placeholders,
CI for contracts and mobile, documentation, risk register, and evidence folder structure.

**Warning:** This repo is for testnet and research. Do not deploy contracts to mainnet without thorough audits.
