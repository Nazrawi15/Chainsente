# 💸 ChainSente: Crypto Lending Meets Mobile Money in Uganda

**On-chain lending, off-chain access.**  
ChainSente is a Cardano-powered DeFi platform that enables users in Uganda to borrow stablecoins with mobile money and build credit on-chain — no bank account required.

> “Lend ADA, borrow USDC, repay with MTN. ChainSente brings DeFi to where it matters.”

---

## ⚠️ Problem

Uganda has 30M+ mobile money users, but:

- 📉 Lack access to affordable, short-term loans
- 🚫 Can’t build credit on-chain
- 🏦 Are excluded from crypto-backed lending tools
- 💱 Face unstable lending terms & opaque repayment

Traditional DeFi ignores the infrastructure that most Africans rely on: **mobile money**.

---

## 🧠 The ChainSente Solution

ChainSente creates a bridge between Cardano DeFi and mobile money wallets (e.g. MTN, Airtel Money). Anyone can:

- ✅ Collateralize ADA, DJED, or other assets
- 🔄 Receive loans in mobile money (USDT/USDC equivalents)
- 📱 Repay loans via mobile wallet top-ups
- 📊 Build credit history stored as DID + on-chain NFT

Everything is transparent, decentralized, and compatible with local economic behavior.

## 🔁 How It Works

| Component            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧱 Smart Contracts     | Built in Plutus. Handles collateral, loan issuance, repayments, and NFT credit logs |
| 🪙 Stablecoin Lending | Loans issued in Cardano-native stablecoins (e.g. DJED, iUSD)                |
| 📲 Mobile Integration | Works with Uganda’s mobile money APIs (via aggregators like Flutterwave)   |
| 🧾 Credit Profile     | Unique NFT + DID to track borrower behavior and enable credit scoring       |
| 🛂 Identity System     | Non-custodial, opt-in KYC via Atala PRISM or similar DID solution           |
| 🌐 Frontend           | Simple PWA + Android-first UI with wallet + MM support                     |

## 💥 Why It Matters

- 📍 Local-first: Built for mobile-first users, not browser wallet power users.
- 🏦 Financial inclusion: First-time borrowers get access to DeFi without needing banks.
- 💼 Real credit: Repayment behavior builds a blockchain-verifiable credit file.
- 🤝 Trustless and trackable: All actions are visible on-chain.
